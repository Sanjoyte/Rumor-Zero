# Rumor Zero: durable agent memory

This file stores verified, durable context that a later Claude Code or Codex session would not
reliably infer from the codebase. It is not a progress log. Product and technical decisions belong
in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`; D-decision reasoning belongs in `docs/ANALYSIS.md`; part status belongs
in `task.md`; transient continuation state belongs in `HANDOFF.md`.

## Maintenance rules

- Add only verified facts or user-approved decisions that are likely to affect later parts.
- Include the date, affected part(s), evidence/source and consequence.
- Update an existing entry instead of adding a contradictory duplicate.
- Remove or mark an entry superseded when its canonical source changes.
- Never store secrets, credentials, personal tokens, raw env values, guesses or chat transcripts.

### 2026-09-30 — Dual-agent continuity

- **Applies to:** all parts.
- **Decision:** Claude Code and Codex work sequentially in one checkout. `AGENTS.md` is their shared
  instruction source; `HANDOFF.md` holds live state; approved plans live under `plans/`.
- **Consequence:** either agent may maintain shared docs and continue the other's work, but they
  must not edit the same checkout concurrently. A user starts the incoming agent; cross-vendor
  takeover is not automatic.
- **Evidence:** user request and the repository-level dual-agent setup added on this date.
